## Devlog
### Week 1 Devlog ¨C Reflection on Components, GameObjects, and Scenes
Unity feels like an ocean ecosystem. The Sceneis the sea itself, an open space where all life interacts. Each GameObject is a creature within it.
That¡¯s where Components come in. They¡¯re the gills, fins, and instincts that make every creature behave differently. Changing Components feels like deciding how fast a fish swims or how coral responds to waves. When everything flows together, the Scene becomes a living, breathing world.
